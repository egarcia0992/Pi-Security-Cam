# Pi-Security-Cam
A lightweight secuity camera program for the Raspberry Pi Zero W that makes 10 minute videos and saves them
on the device inside the Footage directory. Also deletes the oldest videos whenever Footage goes over 20GB.
Make sure to create a Footage directory and make sure that you correctly copy its path into the Python Script.
